I started this project because I wanted to learn Flutter/Dart and I needed a real project to safely sharpen my claws on.

As a fan of open source home automation and a lot of heterogenous devices all having different styles of MQTT payloads, this was a good opportunity to replace all the generic control programs with a program tailored to my needs.

After trying different frameworks, I chose Riverpod for data-binding and while all the different providers and their notifiers irritated me a lot at the beginning, I'm really happy with that decision now.

This project is Work In Progress and there's a lot of stuff that I would do different now after I learned more Flutter/Dart and which I'm constantly improving when I have the time.

Warning! This app only works in my specific environment but maybe parts can be useful for beginners looking into writing a Flutter/Riverpod/MQTT app themselves.

I'm planning to break it down into a separate project that would be more universal though.
