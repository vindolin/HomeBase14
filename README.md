# HomeBase14 - a custom home automation app

[![Flutter](https://github.com/vindolin/HomeBase14/actions/workflows/flutter.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vindolin/HomeBase14/actions/workflows/flutter.yaml)

**Warning!** This app only works in my specific environment but maybe parts can be useful for beginners looking into writing a Flutter/Riverpod/MQTT app themselves.

You can find a bare bones example here: https://github.com/vindolin/simple_mqtt_riverpod_example

This project was initiated as a platform for me to acquire knowledge in Flutter/Dart, providing a practical scenario to refine my skills.

Being an enthusiast of open-source home automation and owning a variety of devices with diverse MQTT payloads, this project presented an excellent chance to substitute the multiple control programs with one that is custom-made for my requirements.

I experimented with various reactive state frameworks before settling on Riverpod for data-binding.

I have developed a fondness for Flutter’s declarative methodology and the stability of the app it produces.

The project is currently a work in progress, and with the knowledge I’ve gained about Flutter/Dart and the libraries I’m utilizing, there are numerous aspects I would approach differently now.

I am continually refactoring past errors and incorporating new devices as they become part of our household.
